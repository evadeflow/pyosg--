This source tree contains a proof-of-concept to determine whether I could use
boost python and py++ to create python bindings for OpenSceneGraph.  The
answer turns out to be yes, it's quite doable---and probably easier than using
swig (a la osgswig).  Unfortunately, it would *still* be quite a
time-consuming task, so I doubt I'll be able to finish it unless someone pays
me to.  Keeping this code around as how-to for the next time I need to bind a
large C++ code base...
